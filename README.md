# PokeApp

This is a sandbox app centered around the PokeApi. It mainly runs off of JavaScript and can be copied using only the main html, js and css files(3 total). It is set up using Spring and Thymeleaf with a database established using MySQL, but is not necessary to function. This will evntually incorporate the database to display favorited Pokemon. Gotta Catch 'Em All!
